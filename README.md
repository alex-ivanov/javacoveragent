Java Coverage Agent
===================


Very simple coverage agent to grab information about dead methods.

Right now it supports only method coverage information and allows to dump information into plain file 
(format is very similar to CSV) or console.

How to install:

Just add jar file as an agent for your JVM instance. Something like this:

		java -javaagent:agent.jar=coverage.properties -jar yourApp.jar


coverage.properties file contains a configuration for your run. Here is an example:


		OPTION.METHODS.INCLUDE=true

		EXPORTER.TYPE=simple.file
		SIMPLE.EXPORTER.FILE.NAME=coverage-test.data
		#EXPORTER.TYPE=simple.console

		INCLUDE.0=com/test/
		INCLUDE.1=com/test1/
		INCLUDE.2=com/test2/

		EXCLUDE.0=test/test1/doNotCover

Right now agent can dump information into your console (EXPORTER.TYPE=simple.console) or specified text file.
